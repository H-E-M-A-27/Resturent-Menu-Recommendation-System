# Menu Recommendation System Project Report

## Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to develop a menu recommendation system that suggests personalized menu items to users based on their preferences and past interactions. In today's digital age, providing personalized recommendations can significantly enhance user experience and increase customer satisfaction in various domains, including restaurants, e-commerce, and entertainment platforms.

## Data Collection:
General data about menu items, user ratings, and user interactions was collected from various sources such as online restaurant reviews, e-commerce platforms, and social media. The data includes information about users, items (menu items), and ratings provided by users for different items.

## Data Preprocessing:
Before building the recommendation system, the collected data underwent preprocessing steps to ensure its quality and usability. This included handling missing values, filtering out irrelevant information, and encoding categorical variables. Additionally, data normalization may have been performed to bring all features to a similar scale.

## Algorithms Used:
Two main algorithms were employed to build the menu recommendation system:

### Collaborative Filtering:
- Collaborative filtering is a recommendation technique that predicts user preferences based on the preferences of similar users.
- Implemented collaborative filtering using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
- KNNBasic algorithm was used from the Surprise library, which computes the similarity between users or items based on their ratings and recommends items that similar users have liked.
- Accuracy: The accuracy of collaborative filtering algorithms depends on various factors such as the sparsity of the data, the choice of similarity metric, and the neighborhood size (K). Cross-validation techniques such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- NLP techniques were utilized to analyze textual data such as user reviews and feedback.
- Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming were applied to extract meaningful information from the text.
- Sentiment analysis may have been performed to understand the sentiment of user reviews and incorporate it into the recommendation system.

## Results and Evaluation:
The menu recommendation system was evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of the system was analyzed based on the quality of recommendations generated, user satisfaction, and the ability to adapt to new user preferences over time.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the menu recommendation system developed in this project demonstrates the effectiveness of collaborative filtering and NLP techniques in providing personalized menu recommendations to users. By leveraging user preferences and feedback, restaurants and other businesses can enhance customer experience, increase engagement, and drive sales. Further enhancements and optimizations can be made to improve the accuracy and scalability of the recommendation system in real-world applications.

## Future Work:
Future work may involve exploring advanced recommendation techniques such as matrix factorization, deep learning-based approaches, or hybrid models combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering. Additionally, integrating real-time user interactions and feedback into the recommendation system can further enhance its effectiveness and responsiveness to user preferences.
